## Intended Use:  Use cases that were envisioned during development.
#### ∗ Describe the business value of your group’s best remediated model
#### ∗ Describe how your group’s best remediated model is designed to be used
#### ∗ Describe the intended users for your group’s best remediated model
#### ∗ State whether your group’s best remediated model can or cannot be used for any additional purposes


## Training Data
#### ∗ State the source of training data
#### ∗ State how training data was divided into training and validation data
#### ∗ State the number of rows in training and validation data
#### ∗ Define the meaning of all training data columns
#### ∗ Define the meaning of all engineered columns

## Evaluation Data
### ∗ State the source of evaluation (or test) data
### ∗ State the number of rows in evaluation (or test) data
### ∗ State any differences in columns between training and evaluation (or test) data


## Model Details
### ∗ State the columns used as inputs in your group’s best remediated model
### ∗ State the columns used as targets in your group’s best remediated model
### ∗ State the type of your group’s best remediated model
### ∗ State the software used to implement your group’s best remediated model
### ∗ State the version of the modeling software for your group’s best remediated model
### ∗ State the hyperparameters or other settings of your group’s best remediated model

## Quantitative Analysis 
### ∗ State the metrics used to evaluate your group’s best remediated model
### ∗ State the values of the metrics for training, validation, and evaluation (or test) data – evaluation (or test) metrics come from the most recent class full evaluation results, link under
Assignment 1.
### ∗ Provide at least one plot or table from each weekly assignment for a total of at least six plots,
that must include the global variable importance and partial dependence of your group’s best
remediated model.
### ∗ Address other alternative models considered


## Ethical Considerations
#### ∗ Describe potential negative impacts of using your group’s best remediated model:
#### · Consider math or software problems
#### · Consider real-world risks: who, what, when and how?
#### ∗ Describe potential uncertainties relating to the impacts of using your group’s best remediated model:
#### · Consider math or software problems
#### · Consider real-world risks: who, what, when and how?
#### ∗ Describe any unexpected or results encountered during training



## Collaboration
During the project, we fostered a collaborative environment and utilized effective communication channels to ensure smooth collaboration. We primarily communicated through regular team meetings, both in-person and online, where we discussed project progress, shared updates, and addressed any issues or concerns. Additionally, we maintained open communication channels through instant messaging platforms and email for day-to-day interactions.

To divide tasks, we initially assessed each team member's strengths, interests, and areas of expertise. Based on this assessment, we allocated tasks accordingly, considering the individual's skills and workload balance. We aimed for a fair distribution of responsibilities and ensured that each team member had the opportunity to contribute and develop their skills.

In terms of conflict resolution, we encouraged open and respectful discussions when disagreements arose. We actively listened to each other's perspectives, sought common ground, and worked towards finding mutually agreeable solutions. In case of significant conflicts, we sought the guidance of our project advisor or faculty member to help mediate and provide guidance for resolution.

Overall, our collaborative approach, effective communication, task allocation, and conflict resolution strategies allowed us to work efficiently as a team, leverage our collective strengths, and successfully complete the project.
