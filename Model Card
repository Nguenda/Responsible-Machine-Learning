#### The model card I was looking at was the one google produced, and they had a section where you could manipulate the data itself and the ard produced an output. Not sure if we were looking to incoporate but it's definitely cool 

### [**Assignment 1 - Machine Learning Model Training**](https://github.com/arijlodhi/RML_Group3/blob/main/Group_3_Assignment_1.ipynb)

The **assignment 1** statement requests training at least two explainable models while ensuring best practices such as reproducibility, validation-based early stopping, and grid search are used.

For our **assignment 1**, we decided to train five explainable models: EBM, GAM, GLM, XGB, and tree, using the PiML package. For reproducibility, we set the seed to SEED = 12345.

**This portfolio provides the following content for assignment 1:**
